## How hard is Mastermind?
The idea was to see how hard it is to solve mastermind.
The algorithm is pretty simple, it holds a list of all possible solutions.
After every guess, the algorithm checks all possible solutions and removes the impossible ones...

# Result
Pretty anticlimactic, the difficulty increases in a linear fashion.
